## üíª Installation

Requires a **C++17** (or higher) compiler.

1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreaaazo/ToDoCPP.git
   cd ToDoC++
   ```
2. **Compile** and **run** (example using g++ on Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   ./make-file.sh
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   g++ -I include \
    src/main.cpp src/Task.cpp src/TaskManager.cpp src/ToDoApp.cpp src/ConsoleUI.cpp \
    -o ToDoC++
   ```
3. **Windows** users can similarly compile with Visual Studio or MinGW, as long as you link the above files together.  
   *We promise we haven't intentionally left any cross-platform booby traps (the heaviest trap here is forgetting semicolons).*

## üöÄ Usage

Once compiled, run the program:
```bash
./ToDoC++.exe
```
You‚Äôll see a simple menu:
```
1. Add task
2. View task
3. Complete task
4. Delete task
5. Exit
```

1. **Add task**: Prompted for a name and description‚Äîno more scribbling tasks on random sticky notes.  
2. **View task**: Lists all your tasks, reminding you of everything you promised you'd do yesterday.  
3. **Complete task**: Marks a task as done, granting that sweet, sweet feeling of productivity.  
4. **Delete task**: Removes a task from the list forever‚Äîlike that 2016 resolution you‚Äôd rather forget.  
5. **Exit**: Closes the program. Attempts not to guilt-trip you about undone tasks.

> If you accidentally complete the ‚ÄúMake coffee‚Äù task first thing in the morning, you‚Äôre basically unstoppable for the day‚Äîunless you start reading memes instead.

## üèó Classes

### `Task`
- **Purpose:**  
  Represents a single to-do item with a name, description, and completion status.
- **Key Methods:**  
  - `markAsCompleted()` to check tasks off your never-ending list.  
  - `isCompleted()` to confirm whether you can lounge guilt-free.

### `TaskManager`
- **Purpose:**  
  Manages a collection of `Task` objects.
- **Key Methods:**  
  - `addTask(name, description)`: Because your memory is short.  
  - `completeTask(index)`: Because your will is strong.  
  - `removeTask(index)`: Because sometimes tasks deserve to be ‚Äúlost‚Äù forever.

### `ConsoleUI`
- **Purpose:**  
  Handles all user interaction via the console. Think: *‚ÄúPress 1 for new regrets.‚Äù*
- **Key Methods:**  
  - `showMenu()`, `getUserChoice()`: Steering the user‚Äôs fate.  
  - `displayTasks(...)`: Spams your terminal with your tasks (and a pinch of existential dread).

### `ToDoApp`
- **Purpose:**  
  Orchestrates the entire show. Creates and binds the `ConsoleUI` with the `TaskManager`.
- **Key Method:**  
  - `run()`: The main application loop‚Äîlike a well-trained hamster wheel.

## üìÑ Documentation

**Location:**  
Feel free to generate further docs using your favorite Doxygen configuration or rummage through the `.h` and `.cpp` files to discover the joys of function prototypes and witty comments.

**Developer Protip:**  
Be sure to read `ToDoApp.cpp` and `ConsoleUI.cpp` for the main flow. If you‚Äôre allergic to reading code, you can always do `doxygen Doxyfile` (if you set it up) and swirl through the generated HTML docs with that fancy new web browser of yours.

2. **Create** a new feature branch.  
3. **Commit** your changes (sprinkle in tests if possible).

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **C++ Community**: For endless discussions on templates and segfaults that gave us nightmares and knowledge in equal measure.  
- **Coffee**: For fueling us through tasks that never ended, especially that one time we wrote code at 3 AM.  
- **Your Future Self**: For eventually remembering to do laundry.
